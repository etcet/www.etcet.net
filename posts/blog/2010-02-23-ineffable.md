We must be humble enough to know that we humans are not the upper bound. Just as we can not know the universe we cannot alone understand ourselves nor any other human. We are drops in a wave of the grand emergence, set to resonate against enforced constraints.

We are a parallel machine running billions of processes. But human communication is inaccurate, itâ€™s second hand, inferior to the ineffable truth of human experience.

An intelligent machine could communicate bit-perfect memories, experiences, thoughts and ideas to another machine. With human-machine augmentation, we could do the same.

The collective consciousness becomes tangible.
