I came across [this one-line command](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2156494) to watch Al-Jazeera English natively in Linux. It uses rtmpdump to connect to the [RTMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Messaging_Protocol) video stream server and then pipes the output to mplayer. I was so delighted at how well this worked on my low-power computer. It usually struggles to play video which is contained in a flash container and now I could bypass flash! So, I spent some time with google and wireshark (a packet analyzer) and created one-liners for as many live RTMP streams as I could find.
