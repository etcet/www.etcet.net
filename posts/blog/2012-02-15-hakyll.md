I've redesigned this website once again. Now, I use [hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) to generate a static site from a set of a templates and content data (mostly formatted using [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)). My personal site is quite small and it's possible to host the entire thing on Amazon's S3 cloud storage service. This avoids the need for a server (well, mostly) and results in fast response times at very low cost.

I based my site on Petar Radošević's [wunki](http://www.wunki.org). My code (and his) is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/etcet/www.etcet.net).
